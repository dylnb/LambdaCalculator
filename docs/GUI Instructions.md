# **GUI Instructions**

The Lambda Calculator GUI cannot be edited using NetBeans, so make sure you are using a different IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. The following are instructions for editing the GUI in Eclipse:

1.  Download `WindowsBuilder` for Eclipse [here](https://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/download.php)
2. Follow the instructions from [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeswfZz4IW0)
3. Go to the `GUI` package in Eclipse for the LambdaCalculator project.
4. For any file, right click and go to `open with`, `WindowBuilder Editor`.
5. At the bottom of the code window should be two tabs, `source` and `design`.
6. Go to `design`, to edit and work on the GUI

NOTE: For any custom components, in the palette section, right click on the folder you want to insert the component into, and click on `add component`. Search for the component by typing it in, and click on the `.jar` file to add it in.
